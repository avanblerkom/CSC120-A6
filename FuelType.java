// DO NOT MODIFY
// In Java, we can use the keyword "enum" to establish simple type that must take as its value
// one of a set of predefined constant values.
// anytime someone is using FuelType, it must be one of the following types:
public enum FuelType {
    STEAM, INTERNAL_COMBUSTION, ELECTRIC, OTHER;
}
