What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think unit testing is really useful, even if just to make me consider what edge cases might not pass. It was better for me to think through ways to test a function before trying to write code! Think through potential edge cases before writing code for tests.

Here is my advice for others: 
Always make attributes private and provide public getter and setter methods to access or modify them. This ensures better control over how attributes are accessed and updated, reducing the risk of unintended side effects. For example, using getter methods like `getSeatsRemaining()` instead of directly accessing attributes helps maintain encapsulation and avoids potential compilation errors.
